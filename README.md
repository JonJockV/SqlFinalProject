What the project does:
  This is a project that uses user input to add games and players to a database. It adds the game using the relevant, given, information and then connects that game to the developer that made it. Along with having CRUD operations on the main table, the game table, it allows for the creation of players and also the retrieval of the developers from the developer table. Players, when made, are connected with the games that they play and are also stored within the game table as players who play that game.

Why the project is useful:
  This codes usefulness comes from the ability to store and retrieve games that you and/or your friends play. It lets you store the basic data on the games, like genre and location, while also keeping the data organized and concise.

How users can get started with the project:
  To get started, you will have to have all the dependecies and such installed on your IDE. This uses Spring boot, Lombok, Jpa, and others as listed in the Pom.xml. Once those are in you need a REST client to send the requests from. Once those are available you can use the code without issue.

  The main, and only, contributor to this project is me, Benjamin Karl or JonJockV as is my name on GitHub,
